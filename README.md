# Flat coin in magnetic field
For the team project, 3D models of an oscilloscope, a engine, a generator, a voltmeter, Helmholtz coils and a flat coil were developed.
<h3>Introduction</h3>
The project is modeling the installation to study the phenomenon
electromagnetic induction. The virtual installation contains a flat coil driven
in rotation by the engine and located in a uniform magnetic field of Helmholtz coils.
